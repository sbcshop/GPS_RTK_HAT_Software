# GPS RTK HAT 

This ZED-F9P-based Raspberry Pi GNSS HAT provides centimeter-level accuracy in seconds. It offers features such as: multi-band RTK with quick convergence times, a high update rate, support for moving base RTK mode, simultaneous reception of four GNSS systems, support for augment positioning systems, accurate & quick positioning with minimal drifting, and exceptional anti-spoofing & anti-jamming capabilities.

It can pinpoint your location, your direction, and your path to any place on Earth in less than 30 seconds. Hence, the higher the accuracy, the better! Since GPS Real Time Kinematics (RTK) has mastered fine-tuning its GPS modules' accuracy to only millimetres, we had to incorporate it on this board!

High-precision GPS was improved by SB Components' GPS-RTK HAT. It has the most latest ZED-F9P module from u-blox, which provides 10mm of 3-dimensional precision. These boards can create X, Y, and Z locations that are about the width of your fingernail. You read that correctly. A stream of correction data from an RTCM source and a strong antenna are both necessary for high accuracy GPS.

## Hardware Overview

Specifications Image(.jpg)

#### Battery
A small lithium battery can be seen in the little metal disc immediately to the right of the ZED-F9R module, precisely like the breakout board. The key mechanisms inside the IC that enable a speedy reconnection to satellites are powered by this battery rather than the IC itself, as the 3.3V system does. When it has a lock, the battery will allow for a two-second time to first fix, however the time to first repair will be around 26 seconds. This is referred to as a "hot start," and it continues for four hours after the board is turned off. While the board is powered, the battery steadily charges and may run the backup system for more than a year. Let your module sit for a complete charge.


#### LED’s
Just like the breakout board, there are four LEDs on the bottom left of the board. Starting from the left:

* ***PWR:*** The power LED labeled as PWR will illuminate when 3.3V is activated.
* ***PPS:*** The pulse per second LED labeled as PPS will illuminate each second once a position lock has been achieved. This generates a pulse that is synchronized with a GPS or UTC time grid. By default, you'll see one pulse a second.

* ***RTK:*** The RTK LED will be illuminated constantly upon power-up. Once RTCM data has been successfully received it will begin to blink. This is a good way to see if the ZED-F9R is getting RTCM from various sources. Once an RTK fix is obtained, the LED will turn off.

* ***GF:*** The GEO LED can be configured to turn on/off for geofencing applications.

#### USB
To connect the ZED-F9R to u-center software, you can attach a USB Type-C cable to the connector.

## Steps to Setup With Pi:

**Step.1 -** To start working with our GPS RTK HAT with Rasberry pi/Rock pi, you to setup your pi board to boot by uploading lates OS of it.

**Step.2 -** After that, attach the GPS RTK HAT on your Pi board and power it by providing suitable power supply. 

**Step.3 -** Once your Pi is booted, open command line and type the below command to clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/sbcshop/GPS_RTK_HAT_Software.git
```

**Step.4 -** After downloading this repository in your Pi board, you can run any of examples provided in this repository.

For using this HAT with USB cable you have to install the USB driver and a Software Application of ublox. For this you can visit the links below, [**Download USB Driver**](https://deviceinbox.com/drivers/1870-u-blox-gnss-standard-usb-driver.html) [**Download Software Application**](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center) and we have also provided it in this repository. After making these setup follow the steps below:

**Step.1 -** After intalling the above mentioned software, plugin your GPS RTK HAT to your system via USB Type-C cable and check for the available COM port. As shon in below image

**Step.2 -** Ublox begins to receive data from numerous satellites from different country as soon as you connect to the correct port, as seen in the figure below.
